- 👋 Hi, I’m Rajesh Nakka
- 👀 I’m interested in composites [especially computational] damage modelling, utilizing machine learning techniques.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning computational **homogenization** methods, computational languages **Julia**, **Python**
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects involved in developing opensource [supporting] tools for composites damage modelling.
